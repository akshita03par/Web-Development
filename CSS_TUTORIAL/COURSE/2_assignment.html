     <!-- poem -->
      <p>
       I met a traveller from an antique land , <br>
       Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
       Stand in the desert . . . . Near them , on the sand ,<br>
       Half sunk a shattered visage lies , whose frown <br>
       And wrinkled lip,and sneer of cold command,<br>
       Tell that its sculptor, stamped on these lifeless things <br>
       The hand that mocked them ,and the heart that fed ; <br>
       And on the pedestal , these words appear : <br>
       My name is Ozymandias , King of Kings ; <br>
       Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
       Nothing beside remains . Round the delay <br>
       of that colossal Wreck , boundless and bare <br>
       The lone and level sands stretch far away ." <br>
      </p>
